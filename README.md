# hello-world-api

NodeJS Masterclass assignment

This version features [ES2015](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/learn/) syntax linted with [ESLint Airbnb style guide](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb).

This file just handles requests to the route: `/hello`. It only does GET and POST requets, actually.

For simplicity, the port is defined directly in index.js. Simply edit this variable to use a different port.

Also, for simplicity, we only handle `http` - no `https` or certificates, etc.

Minimal `400` error handling is provided.
